Building and Running:
============
- You can use standard Maven commands to build and run your JavaFX application:
  - `mvn clean install`: Builds the project and installs artifacts to your local Maven repository.
  - `mvn javafx:run`: Runs the JavaFX application directly from Maven.
  - `mvn package`: Creates a distributable package, often a "fat JAR" containing all dependencies, allowing the application to run on other machines.
